Employee Management System

> ?? Project under development – things may change frequently!

This project is a RESTful Web API built with ASP.NET Core for securely managing employee data. It enforces role-based access control using JWT authentication and provides clear logging and comprehensive test coverage.

? Features:
?? JWT Authentication & Role-based Authorization (Admin, HR, Employee)

?? CRUD operations for Employee records

??? Service & Repository pattern

?? Unit Testing with xUnit

?? Structured Logging using ILogger

?? Swagger UI for API documentation and testing

?? Access Control:
Admins and HR can access all employee data.

Regular employees can only view or modify their own records.

Unauthorized actions return proper HTTP status codes (403 or 401).

This solution is designed with clean architecture principles and is ready for production-level enhancements.
